# Roadmap

The roadmap here is a living document of where the client-facing app is intending to go and things needed to be done in the near future. Since we can't really predict the best way of doing things, this may be flexible and subject to change.

## Timeline
As the Spectator Web Application has been able to stick around for the last few years, we're going to continue the maintance of the application, potentially improving the ✨User Experience✨ with small quality-of-life improvements.

## Short term goals
These goals should be tackled as a priority.

* Media section on the homepage
* Worldbeat on the homepage
* Anonymous comment section - INCLUDING WORD FILTER!

## Long term goals
These goals are more difficult to give a timeline for. They are ordered by increasing difficulty.
* Newsletter for subscribers via email.
* Get the CLI in order so that articles can be uploaded the day of issue publish, preferably available at the same time as paper copies.
* Fine grained analytics- views per article, time and percent of read, overall site data.
* More article designs and more control over designs for writers.

## Backlog
The backlog covers features that aren't long-term goals but would be useful to have.
* Offer offline capability either on the website or by an app for readers taking the subway.
